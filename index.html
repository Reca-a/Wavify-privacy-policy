<p>
The App operates fully offline and does not require user accounts, login, or internet-based data processing.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Device and App Information</h2>
<p>
The App may access basic device information provided by the Android operating system
(such as Android version or device model) solely for proper functionality.
This information is not stored, transmitted, or used to identify users.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Third-Party Libraries</h2>
<p>
The App uses standard Android and open-source libraries, including:

    <li>Media3 / ExoPlayer (for media playback)</li>
    <li>Coil (for image loading)</li>

<h2>4. App Permissions</h2>

<p>
The App requires the following permissions to function properly:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Access to media files (audio)</strong> - used only to allow the App
        to read and play audio files stored locally on the user's device.
        The App <strong>does not upload, store, or share these files</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Notifications</strong> - used to display playback controls while audio
        is playing in the background.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
All permissions are used solely for core application functionality.
</p>

<hr>

Since no personal data is collected or stored, there is no risk of personal data leakage.
The App follows standard Android security practices.
