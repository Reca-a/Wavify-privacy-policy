<h1>Wavify - Privacy Policy</h1>
    
<p>Last updated: <strong>2025-12-28</strong></p>
    
<p>
This application ("App") is developed as part of an educational project for academic purposes by <strong>Adrian Raczek</strong>.
I respect your privacy and am committed to protecting it.
</p>
    
<hr>
    
<h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    
<p>
The App <strong>does not collect, store, or share any personal data</strong> from users.
</p>
    
<p>
The App operates fully offline and does not require user accounts, login, or internet-based data processing.
</p>
    
<hr>
    
<h2>2. Device and App Information</h2>
    
<p>
The App may access basic device information provided by the Android operating system
(such as Android version or device model) solely for proper functionality.
This information is not stored, transmitted, or used to identify users.
</p>
    
<hr>
    
<h2>3. Third-Party Libraries</h2>
    
<p>
The App uses standard Android and open-source libraries, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>AndroidX libraries</li>
    <li>Media3 / ExoPlayer (for media playback)</li>
    <li>Coil (for image loading)</li>
    <li>Material Components</li>
    <li>CameraX (for camera access)</li>
    <li>Google ML Kit Vision (for gesture recognition processing)</li>
</ul>
    
<p>
These libraries do not collect personal data on behalf of the App. All processing occurs locally on your device.
</p>
    
<hr>
    
<h2>4. App Permissions</h2>
    
<p>
The App requires the following permissions to function properly:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Access to media files (audio)</strong> - used only to allow the App
        to read and play audio files stored locally on the user's device.
        The App <strong>does not upload, store, or share these files</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Notifications</strong> - used to display playback controls while audio
        is playing in the background.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Camera access</strong> - used exclusively for real-time gesture recognition
        to control music playback (e.g., switching tracks with hand gestures).
        <strong>No photos or videos are captured, recorded, saved, or transmitted.</strong>
        Camera data is processed locally on the device in real-time and is immediately discarded
        after gesture detection. No camera data leaves your device.
    </li>
</ul>
    
<p>
All permissions are used solely for core application functionality and can be revoked at any time
through your device settings.
</p>
    
<hr>
    
<h2>5. Camera Usage Details</h2>
    
<p>
The camera permission is used only for gesture recognition features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Camera feed is processed in real-time on your device only</li>
    <li>No images, videos, or camera data are saved</li>
    <li>No camera data is transmitted to any server or third party</li>
    <li>Camera usage occurs only when the gesture control feature is actively enabled by the user</li>
    <li>You can disable this feature at any time, and the camera will not be accessed</li>
</ul>
    
<hr>
    
<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    
<p>
Since no personal data is collected or stored, there is no risk of personal data leakage.
The App follows standard Android security practices. All camera processing happens locally
on your device with no data transmission.
</p>
    
<hr>
    
<h2>7. User Rights</h2>
    
<p>
As the App does not collect personal data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete.
Users have full control over app permissions and can revoke camera access at any time through
device settings.
</p>
    
<hr>
    
<h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    
<p>
This App does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13.
The App is designed for general audiences and does not target children specifically.
</p>
    
<hr>
    
<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated if the App functionality changes.
Any updates will be published on this page with a revised "Last updated" date.
